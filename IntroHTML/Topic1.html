     My name is Cody Walden and this paragraph will be about me and my life. I was born on December 15th 1994 in Columbia Missouri and I have lived in Columbia for almost my entire life. I went to fairview elementary school as a young child and later to smithton middle school as a young teenager. Afterwards, I went to high school at Rock Bridge and graduated in the early summer of 2013. After graduating from high school, I decided to take a break from school and not go to college right away as I was not ready at 18 years old. At the age of 21, I finally decided to attend college after my brain began to mature more. I only took two or three classes at a time to not overload myself. I should be graduating in December of 2022 at the age of 27 or 28 after years of working hard to get my degree. Thank you for taking the time to read about my life and I hope you enjoyed reading my about me page.
